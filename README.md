#  Fade of Fame: When Do TV Shows Overstay Their Welcome?

This project explores how audience sentiment toward TV shows changes over time, using user reviews from IMDbâ€™s Top 250 TV Shows. The goal is to understand when and why shows start to decline in perceived quality.

## Summary

Using sentiment analysis and topic modeling on IMDb user reviews, this project identifies trends in viewer sentiment across seasons and episodes, revealing patterns such as:

- A general decline in sentiment after season 9.
- Genre-specific sentiment trajectories.
- Shifts in themes and audience engagement over time.

## Project Structure

- `scraper.py`: A Python web scraper built with Selenium to extract user reviews, ratings, genres, and episode information from IMDb.
- `imdb_reviews_analysis.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook containing the sentiment analysis, topic modeling, data visualization, and validation.
- `show_data.csv`: Folder containing the dataset (CSV format) used in the analysis.
- `README.md`: Current file.

## Methods

### Data Collection
- Scraped ~76,000 IMDb user reviews from Top 250 TV Shows.
- Limited to 20 reviews per episode to maintain consistency.
- Multithreaded scraping for efficiency.

### Sentiment Analysis
- Used TextBlob to compute polarity scores (-1 to +1).
- Aggregated sentiment at episode, season, and genre levels.
- Applied linear regression to detect trends in sentiment over time.

### Topic Modeling
- Applied TF-IDF and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to episode descriptions and user reviews.
- Analyzed shifts in focus and themes before and after sentiment declines.

### Validation
- Manual review of sentiment classifications.
- Correlation analysis between sentiment scores and IMDb user ratings.
- Precision, recall, and F1-score metrics calculated.

## Key Findings

- **Decline in Sentiment**: Most TV shows show a drop in sentiment after their early seasons.
- **Genre Effects**: Genres like 'Boxing' and 'Adventure Epic' maintain high sentiment; genres like 'Dinosaur Adventure' and 'True Crime' show steep declines.
- **Narrative Shifts**: Topic modeling reveals thematic changes that may explain drops in viewer satisfaction.
